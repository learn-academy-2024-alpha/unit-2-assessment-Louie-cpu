## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: A certain React data structure used to store data inside a react component. Once stored it is available to the entire react component.

2. React Props: Specialized react objects used to pass information from one component to another. Create an undirectional flow of data and behavior from one component to another nested component using component invocation.  

3. DOM events: interactions on the computer like moving the mouse, clicking on something, hovering over something with the mouse, and typing. Direct Object Model Events
